I created this folder from ./Neutrones_dummyF12
to include the new materials sand following the cristanchoÂ´s model
of the soil and doing the sim at different moistures

see:

theta1_theta_2_Vs_rho_with_delta_theta_0.05.dat
(specially the note at the end of the file)

pruebas/prueba1/ seems OK in the definition of the materiasl and the geometry
(G4Data0.heprep)

the folder

d_5cm_moistures/

has the diferent runs with d=5cm and diferent moistures
from 0% TO 70% (by weight...see the note in the file: 

theta1_theta_2_Vs_rho_with_delta_theta_0.05.dat


I created the folder 

d_0cm_moistures/

with the same runs as in d_5cm_moistures/ but for d=0cm.

Note: The same runs I did in ../Neutrones_dummyF12 but with more neutron events.

Hi!! I'm Zandra

I created this folder Neutrones_dummyF13_mod of Neutrones_dummyF13
wich was created by Angel Cruz.

In this version of simulation I change the name of the detectors according to
the experimental setup.

This is the previous setup

 --- --- --- ---                --- --- --- ---
| 5 | 3 | 1 | A |             | B | 2 | 4 | 6 |
|   |   |   |   |   source    |   |   |   |   |  ---->
 --- --- --- ---               --- --- --- ---       x

The number 1 up to 8 are the number of the neutron 
detector.

The new setup is 

 --- --- --- ---                --- --- --- ---
| 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 |             | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |
|   |   |   |   |   source    |   |   |   |   |  ---->
 --- --- --- ---               --- --- --- ---       x

The idea of the new setup is to use the detectors 1,2, 7 and 8 in
ordet to locate the mine in the axis y.
